next steps 

update so singlephoto can be used for addphoto framework. i think singlephoto needs to be class method and update state there (instead of on addphoto)

change repo name
update indentation so eslint isnt annoying!
change names to baked goods. filters can be vegan, cake, cookie cupcake etc
